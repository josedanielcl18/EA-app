#### üöÄ How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd ea-football-predictor
    ```

2.  **Set up Firebase**:
    This application requires a Firebase project to store game data and user predictions.
    * Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Enable **Firestore Database** and **Firebase Authentication** (with Email/Password sign-in).
    * Find your project's configuration details (API Key, Project ID, etc.) and replace the `firebaseConfig` object in your `index.html` and `tabla.html` files with your own.

3.  **Run a Local Server**:
    To properly load the Firebase module imports and other local files, you need to run a local web server. The simplest way is to use Python's built-in server.
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    If you don't have Python, you can use a different web server like `npx serve`.

4.  **Open in Browser**:
    After the server starts, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal, usually `http://localhost:8000`.
